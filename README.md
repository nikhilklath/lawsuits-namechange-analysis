The name of a company encapsulates its past performance and conveys the company’s characteristics. Past glories of a name can stand for the quality of a company’s current products even in the face of moral hazard, adverse selection or both. At the same time, firm name change is a regularly and deliberately adopted practice. 

Over 30% of Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP)-listed companies changed their name at least once when publicly traded (Wu (2010)). Given the billions of dollars companies spend to build name recognition and the costs associated with the name change process, an extensive literature exists on the motivation for company renaming. One explanation is that brand name value decreases when a company performs poorly, and the firm wants to distance itself from this old image through renaming (McDevitt (2011), Lee (2001), Carson et al (2016)).
